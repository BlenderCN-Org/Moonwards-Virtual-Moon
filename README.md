# Moonwards Virtual Moon
Everything to build the Moonwards space colonies in Godot and Blender.

You must install Git LFS to use this repository, in addition to Git itself, and ensure it is initialized in the folder where you clone the repo. 

For the time being, you can run the following commands in a terminal from inside the folder where the project is to be cloned:

    git init
    git lfs install
    git lfs clone https://github.com/moonwards1/Moonwards-Virtual-Moon.git 
    
Be aware that `git lfs clone` is a deprecated command. It works for now.
